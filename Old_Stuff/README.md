# Master's thesis - Efficient Deep Learning in Space to Detect Illegal Fishing Vessels

Detection of illeagal fishing by using object detection on satellite images to determine positions of vessels to compare to AIS-data.

## Fishing areas where fishing is frequent
- Skagerrak
- Kattegatt (our focus)

# ShuffleNetV1

ShuffleNetV1 implementation is available at [ShuffleNetV1 repo](https://github.com/Ebiz95/ShuffleNetV1).
